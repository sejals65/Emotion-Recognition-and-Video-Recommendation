# Emotion-Recognition-and-Video-Recommendation
The project aims to capture the emotion expressed by a person through facial expressions. 
The software captures the image of the user and then with the help of image processing techniques extracts features from the face of a target human being and tries to detect the emotion that the person is trying to express.
